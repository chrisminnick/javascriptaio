How to make a breakfast taco -

what you will need:
chorizo
egg  (I like a brown egg)
cheese  (I prefer cheddar but whateber you like)
tortillas
pepper
tabasco sauce (some people like habanero cause it is hotter)
skillet


I usually put the skillet on medium, heat it up,  and put in half a link of chorizo (about 3 inches)
chup up the chorizo and let it fry until it turns brown.  Stir in the pepper and tobasco.  
Don't char the chorizo.  As it falls apart into tiny chunks it will brown real fast, about a minute.
As soon as it is brown, crack the egg and scramble it in with the chorizo real quick.
Keep stirring as it cooks and it should be done in a bout a minute.

You should have warmed up the tortillas (corn or flour)  This amount of food will make 2 tacos.
Just pour the stuff onto the tortilla and add shredded cheese.  Fold the bottom then roll and you now have
a breakfast taco.  enjoy!
